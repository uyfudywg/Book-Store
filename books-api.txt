This colloquium was established by the BCS IRSG(B- tish Computer Society Information Retrieval Specialist Group), and named the Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research. Recently, the location of the colloquium has alternated between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. To re?ect the growing European orientation of the event, the colloquium was renamed “European Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research” from 2001. Since the inception of the colloquium in 1979 the event has been hosted in the city of Glasgow on four separate occasions. However, this was the ?rst time that the organization of the colloquium had been jointly undertaken by three separate computer and information science departments; an indication of the collaborative nature and diversity of IR research within the universities of the West of Scotland. The organizers of ECIR 2002 saw a sharp increase in the number of go- quality submissions in answer to the call for papers over previous years and as such 52 submitted papers were each allocated 3 members of the program committee for double blind review of the manuscripts. A total of 23 papers were eventually selected for oral presentation at the colloquium in Glasgow which gave an acceptance rate of less than 45% and ensured a very high standard of the papers presented.",

To make that perfectly clear, they called any phenomenon they intended to study a 'variable', indicating that the phenomenon could vary in size, length, amount, or any other quantity. Unfortunately, not many phenomena in the human world comes naturally in quantities. If we cannot even give a useful answer to what qualitative analysis is and how it works, then it seems rather incongruent to try and involve a computer, the very essence of precision and orderliness. Isn't qualitative analysis a much too individualistic and flexible an activity to be supported by a computer? Won't a computer do exactly what qualitative researchers want to avoid, namely standardize the process? Won't it mechanize and rigidify qualitative analysis? The answer to these questions is NO, and this book explains why.",

It analyses the realities of offering services such as education, translation, editing and writing, and then considers the challenges and benefits that result when these boundaries are consciously blurred. It thus provides an opportunity for readers to reflect on their professional roles and the services that will best serve their clients' needs. A recurring theme is, therefore, the interaction between language professional and client-author. The book offers insights into the opportunities and challenges presented by considering ourselves first and foremost as writing support professionals, differing in our primary approach (through teaching, translating, editing, writing, or a combination of those) but with a common goal. This view has major consequences for the training of professionals who support English-language publication by NNES academics and scientists. Supporting Research Writing will therefore be a stimulus to professional development for those who support English-language publication in real-life contexts and an important resource for those entering the profession. - Takes a holistic approach to writing support and reveals how it is best conceived as a spectrum of overlapping and interrelated professional activities - Stresses the importance of understanding the real-world needs of authors in their quest to publish - Provides insights into the approaches used by experienced practitioners across Europe",

            "description": "The book lies at the interface of mathematics, social media analysis, and data science. Its authors aim to introduce a new dynamic modeling approach to the use of partial differential equations for describing information diffusion over online social networks. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix for the underlying social network are used to find communities (clusters) of online users. Once these clusters are embedded in a Euclidean space, the mathematical models, which are reaction-diffusion equations, are developed based on intuitive social distances between clusters within the Euclidean space. The models are validated with data from major social media such as Twitter. In addition, mathematical analysis of these models is applied, revealing insights into information flow on social media. Two applications with geocoded Twitter data are included in the book: one describing the social movement in Twitter during the Egyptian revolution in 2011 and another predicting influenza prevalence. The new approach advocates a paradigm shift for modeling information diffusion in online social networks and lays the theoretical groundwork for many spatio-temporal modeling problems in the big-data era.",

This accessible text provides comprehensive course content that meets and exceeds the curriculum standards set by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). Written by expert authors specializing in pharmacy practice and research, this valuable text will provide pharmacy students and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of drug literature evaluation with a strong grounding in research and biostatistical principles. Principles of Research Design and Drug Literature Evaluation is an ideal foundation for professional pharmacy students and a key resource for pharmacy residents, research fellows, practitioners, and clinical researchers. FEATURES * Chapter Pedagogy: Learning Objectives, Review Questions, References, and Online Resources * Instructor Resources: PowerPoint Presentations, Test Bank, and an Answer Key * Student Resources: a Navigate Companion Website, including Crossword Puzzles, Interactive Flash Cards, Interactive Glossary, Matching Questions, and Web Links From the Foreword: \"This book was designed to provide and encourage practitioner’s development and use of critical drug information evaluation skills through a deeper understanding of the foundational principles of study design and statistical methods. Because guidance on how a study’s limited findings should not be used is rare, practitioners must understand and evaluate for themselves the veracity and implications of the inherently limited primary literature findings they use as sources of drug information to make evidence-based decisions together with their patients. The editors organized the book into three supporting sections to meet their pedagogical goals and address practitioners’ needs in translating research into practice. Thanks to the editors, authors, and content of this book, you can now be more prepared than ever before for translating research into practice.\" L.

The volume focuses especially on economic studies that examine interactions of multiple agents and/or market phenomena by using behavioral economics models. Reflecting the diverse fields of the editors, the book captures broad influences of behavioral economics on various topics in economics. Those subjects include parental altruism, economic growth and development, the relative and permanent income hypotheses, wealth distribution, asset price bubbles, auctions, search, contracts, personnel management and market efficiency and anomalies in financial markets. The chapter authors have added newly written addenda to the original articles in which they address their own subsequent works, supplementary analyses, detailed information on the underlying data and/or recent literature surveys. This will help readers to further understand recent developments in behavioral economics and related research.",

This invaluable guide provides step-by-step instructions for investigating Internet crimes, including locating, interpreting, understanding, collecting, and documenting online electronic evidence to benefit investigations. Cybercrime is the fastest growing area of crime as more criminals seek to exploit the speed, convenience and anonymity that the Internet provides to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. Today's online crime includes attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, distribution of child pornography, penetration of online financial services, using social networks to commit crimes, and the deployment of viruses, botnets, and email scams such as phishing. Symantec's 2012 Norton Cybercrime Report stated that the world spent an estimated $110 billion to combat cybercrime, an average of nearly $200 per victim. Law enforcement agencies and corporate security officers around the world with the responsibility for enforcing, investigating and prosecuting cybercrime are overwhelmed, not only by the sheer number of crimes being committed but by a lack of adequate training material. This book provides that fundamental knowledge, including how to properly collect and document online evidence, trace IP addresses, and work undercover. - Provides step-by-step instructions on how to investigate crimes online - Covers how new software tools can assist in online investigations - Discusses how to track down, interpret, and understand online electronic evidence to benefit investigations - Details guidelines for collecting and documenting online evidence that can be presented in court",

And world-renowned quilt maker, teacher, author, and show judge Nancy Brenan Daniel has created an inspiring guide just for them, with ideas for 18 varied and beautiful hand-sewn quilts. Her detailed instructions cover it all, from making the blocks and stitching them together to adding borders and binding. Many of the designs come straight from Nancy’s own antique collection, and they’re pieced, appliqu�d, and even stenciled. Several traditional and much loved patterns--including the Courthouse Log Cabin, Shoo-fly, Prickly Pear, and Windblown Daisy--are accompanied by a contemporary appliqu� quilt and a small hand-embroidered wall hanging.",
